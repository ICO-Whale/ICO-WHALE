# Alchemint

* Idea is to make a stable coin that you peg with a smart contract for a given period of time, would give you a calculated amount
	- Amount is dynamic
	- Can be liquidated
	- Solves liqudation problem with stating they would have someone with large/unlimited liquidity of stablecoin

* Only offers Qualified Alchemists, aka exchanges, that can use the coin in a sdbond.
	- They would be the one giving out the loans using SAR
	- This would make it so that everything would be on blockchain
	- Could lead to NEO DEX being further legimitized if they were offering a SAR to margin??

* They are building a service for something that is often used in crypto
	- Margin trading
	- leverage based on the amount of crypto that you put in bond? Or other options

* They are building forecasting mechanism of the markets to make it so that the smart contract is what closes your margin trade not something else
	- Allows to super easy compliance auditing of trades
	- Allows super easy reporting of trades
	- Allows controlled, verifiable margin calls

* Seems like it requires that you work with there foundation to be able to issues SAR
	- Not issue for big exchange

* Alchemint Foundation
	- Non-profit
	- established in Singapore in Jan 2018
