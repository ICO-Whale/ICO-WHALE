# CardStack
* they are trying to make apps on the net a monthly/usage payment model
* where things in the cloud services industry is going
* they are trying to link service blockchains together and let people combine things more easily like using sia coin + as back end storage for your order book getting matched on ZRX
* they want to people to build services using all the other different blockchains on top of their system

* they are picking a very niche crowd with their model of allowing users to pick the orchestration of their experience 

* I think they are head of the curve

* I dont think there is enough users that would use this platfrom, as most of them dont really know what any of the these other shitcoins do or what problem they are trying to solve so how are they going to know what to do with a platform to stich it all together?
** CORRECTION: They are only asking a subset of the users to do this and they will host the work of others on the platform

* HUGE PLUS: There github has a fully functioning thing since Sept 2017
* they use yarn which is becoming an industry standard

* Have two coins CARD and SSC, SSC is a stable token pegged to USD, 100 SSC = 1 USD
* SSC is like store credit, in whatever app, when you convert CARD to it
